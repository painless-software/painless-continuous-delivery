How To Contribute
=================

If you want to make this piece of software more useful, better fit your needs,
fix bugs or typos your help is greatly appreciated!

- If you have specific changes that should go into the code base please
  prepare a `pull request`_.
- If you're unsure or need to discuss your ideas please open an issue in our
  `bug tracker`_.
- As a general rule, all code changes need to satisfy the default rules
  enforced by `flake8`_ and `Pylint`_ (PEP8 et al.).
- Please add tests and make sure the builds all pass (run ``tox`` locally).

Testing
-------

We use `tox`_ to run tests against all target environments.  You may want to
use `pyenv`_ to test against all Python version locally.  Alternatively, you
can test only against the versions you already have installed on your machine
like this, wait for the buld servers to cover the missing pieces and fix
identified issues with additional commits:

.. code-block:: bash

    tox -e flake8,pylint,py35,py27

Tests that require Docker must be run locally on your developer machine,
because not all CI servers allow running Docker (inside Docker) on their
infrastructure.  In `behave`_ those tests are tagged with ``@docker``.
Run them with:

.. code-block:: bash

    tox -e behave -- --tags=docker
