Under The Hood
==============

The underscore folders, e.g. ``{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/_``, contain
files that are used to integrate optional content through template includes
or by the `post generate hook`_, according to the choices made during the
cookiecutter execution.

The ``generators`` folder contains scripts to pre-generate code skeletons
that are integrated manually in this cookiecutter (e.g. framework setups).

Please refer to the README files in those folders for additional details.

How Can I Contribute?
=====================
