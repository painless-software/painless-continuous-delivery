Usage
=====

Install `cookiecutter <https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install cookiecutter

Generate a new Cookiecutter template layout:

.. code-block:: bash

Under The Hood
==============

The underscore folder, ``{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/_``, contains files
that are integrated by the post generate hook, ``hooks/post_gen_project.py``,
according to the choices made during the cookiecutter execution.

The ``generators`` folder contains scripts to pre-generate code skeletons
that are integrated manually in this cookiecutter (e.g. framework setups).

Please refer to the README files in those folders for additional details.
